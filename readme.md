# Chess AI

This program is a chess AI developed for the course 02180 Introduction to AI at DTU in the period 21/2-2023 to 20/3-2023.

# Running the program

The program is run by running the file 'FinalChessGame.py'.\
This will open a window in which it is possible to play a game of chess.\
The program currently only allows the player to play with white while the AI plays with black.\
You make a move by clicking on the piece you want to move. This will highlight the piece as well as all legal moves for the piece. If you click on a legal move you play that move and otherwise the highlights will disappear.\
Currently, the player can only promote a pawn to a queen as the GUI doesn't allow for the choice between the different pieces.
